I learned about streamlit and how to use from a playlist on YouTube called ["Streamlit (Web Application in Python)"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtqF5YXg7GLmCvTswG32NqQypOuYkPRUE). I did some of its [projects](https://github.com/Sir-Elite/Streamlit-Projects.git) myself for better understanding. Then, I tried using OpenCV (CV2), but I needed more time to learn it than the time avialable. At the same time, I found the "YOLOv8" which is very good at object detection, but I still have some error displaying the content on the streamlit app. I can display it on the terminal of the text editor, but not the streamlit web app. Maybe, I can do it better with some guidance and time.
